# ðŸ§® Datatypes-Complex Number Creation in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that reads two integers, creates a complex number using them, and then prints the complex number along with its real and imaginary parts.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Read an integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `a` (real part).
2. Read another integer input from the user and assign it to the variable `b` (imaginary part).
3. Create a complex number `c` using the `complex(a, b)` function.
4. Print the complex number `c`.
5. Print the real part of `c` using `c.real`.


## ðŸ’» Program
```
a=complex(input())
b=complex(input())
c=(complex(a,b))
print(c)
print(c.real)
```

## Output
